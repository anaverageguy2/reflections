Why use diff to compare files?

It shows the difference in the files and thus help us in fixing bugs and see the changes we made



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

one can have access to an older version of files and this can help in maintaing working code when ypu are experimenting on new features.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros:
1 commit can be done whenever you want.
2 A lot of small changes which are part of the same logical change will have only one commit 

Cons:
1 you can forget to commit so0mething and then ommit a lot of stuff at the same time



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is more used for programming, where a lot of changes might correspond to one logical change. 
While
google docs is more for human readable documents so each change is a new logical addition.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log can be used to view the different commits made. Git diff can be used to see the difference between the two commits


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

As with version control we can always revert to a past working code , we can freely make changes to code having a working code as backup and helping us identify the bugs introduced in the new broken version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
